# ᵖᶦᶜᵒfetch 
a under 2KB bash program that just fetches some system info :P
(4kb if you account for the install and readme, and snak.txt)

You can modify, edit, change the code however you want.

You can do anything with it, anywhere.

The only requirement is that if you fork the code and make it into your own script, or something, credit me as the original creator.

(See CC-BY, that's basically equivalent to what I'm saying)

Programs used for developing picofetch
nano (text editor) mainly used for local coding/bug-fixing, which I then implement into the repo via the github file editor.

this is an arch-centric script. chances are, the best compatibility is with arch or arch-based distros.
Debian is 2nd priority, as I do have a debian partition that I can test on.
Gentoo is 3rd priority. I haven't tested it, but it likely is compatible.
