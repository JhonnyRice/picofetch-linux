Programs used for developing picofetch
nano (text editor) mainly used for local coding/bug-fixing, which I then implement into the repo via the github file editor.

this is an arch-centric script. chances are, the best compatibility is with arch or arch-based distros.
Debian is 2nd priority, as I do have a debian partition that I can test on.
Gentoo is 3rd priority. I haven't tested it, but it likely is compatible.
