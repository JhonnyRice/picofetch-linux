# ᵖᶦᶜᵒfetch 
a under 2KB bash program that just fetches some system info :P
(4kb if you account for the install and readme, and snak.txt)

You can modify, edit, change the code however you want.

You can do anything with it, anywhere.

The only requirement is that if you fork the code and make it into your own script, or something, credit me as the original creator.

(See CC-BY, that's basically equivalent to what I'm saying)
